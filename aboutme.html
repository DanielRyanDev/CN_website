        <section><em>My name's Dan and welcome to this small chunk of webspace I call my own. I will be using this, mainly, as a way of showcasing my skills and portfolio. However, I have included some other things that may be of interest to you; the reader (or surfer, whatever you prefer.)

        <h2>The Journey Begins...</h2>
        <p>So far, I've had a few achievements throughout my life - some a bit stranger than others. For instance, way back in 2012, I was approached in the middle of Liverpool City Centre by a black-clad lad asking if I wanted to take part in Juice FM's 'Street Style Awards'. Never one to miss an opportunity (nor have the confidence to say 'no' to a stranger), I took up the offer... imagine my surprise when I won it! The awards night was a red carpet affair; celebrities you or I have never heard of and the finest furniture Wayfair had to offer adorned the beautiful innards of Liverpool Cathedral. Fortunately, for me, I had met a girl a few weeks before; looking to impress, I asked her to be my plus one. Nine years later, we're still here together. If she'd have said no - I was to take my mum. Unfortunately, the high-society life of a catalogue model could not deter the allure of fried chicken and pints of Mild. The pounds increased - just not the right kind and I headed off to college and then onto University.

        <h2>The Broth Begins To Boil...</h2>
        <p>
            Around this time, I managed to snag my very first dedicated gaming PC (the benefits of turning 18.) I'd always been a gamer; a nerd, a lover of all things fantasy, sci-fi, and tech - I'd never, up to this point, thought that it could be something that someone like me would be able to pursue. After I finished my Music Btec in college, I took a chance and applied to Liverpool Hope University's new Computer Science degree. Months of waiting with abated breath passed and finally, on my 20th Birthday, a letter came through the door - I had been accepted! In a scene reminiscent of Charlie Bucket finding his Golden Ticket, I skipped to my partner's house to give her the good news - along with some birthday cake, naturally.

        <h2>'Smart Lad, To Slip Betimes Away...'</h2>
        <p>
            Okay, let's cut to the chase: the course wasn't all it cracked up to be. I was expecting to be getting my hands dirty; mastering my craft, cracking problems, conjuring solutions! As Thomas Edison once said: "There's a way to do it better - find it!"... yeah, it didn't happen like that. Instead, I was stuck in a gloomy lecture hall; watching endless lecturers write for statements and while loops, wishing I could be in front of a monitor learning this rather than noting them down in a notepad - only to run into issues with the code later and no clear way of resolving problems. In the end, I switched courses and pursued History and Politics - I had failed. I felt defeated and soon, gray clouds would hang for, what felt like, forever. I got my head down; resigned to the reality that I was destined to be a paper-pusher for the rest of my days. I convinced myself I'd made the right decision - that computers and their whims would never had led to anything for me... quite an odd premise when you consider I'd come home and revel in the (often self-inflicted) challenges that various hardware and software would conjure...

        <h2>Coronavirus (Or How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love Lockdown)</h2>
        <p>
            Anyway, I graduated in January 2020; attended my ceremony (after much persuasion from loved ones), ate a meal, toasted with friends, and went home - not feeling fulfilled very much; an underwhelming affair, by any estimate. Then Coronavirus happened. Then I entered employment. Then everything changed. Being stuck in a dead-end job made me sit up; all that sitting at home not able to go anywhere; stewing away and thinking rather than doing. Honestly? I began to get on my own nerves with my sitting around waiting for something to happene rather than making something happen; I left my job and pursued a Comptia A+ course. At the time of writing, I'm weeks away from my exam - wish me luck folks!

        <h2>The Present & The Future</h2>
        <p>
            That's how I ended up here - writing this overtly-dramatic biography. I have been on every computer course, programme, and, bootcamp I could find - but I hadn't managed to get rid of the coding bug. Enter: CodeNation. I saw that CodeNation were running a three-week course to help get started in the world of coding - I have a cursory knowledge from my year of study and general interest, so why not? The past three weeks, I have learned so much; felt so much better in myself and truly believe I am doing something that is important. I feel fulfilled. Hopefully, I can kick-off from here and launch my career in coding. To paraphrase Charles Dederic: <em>Today is the beginning of the rest of my life</em>. So, as I sit here typing this on my last day of CodeNation, I hope you've found something of worth and, more importantly, humour in my pretentious soliloquy. Anyways, back to trying to figure out why Flexbox isn't working folks! TTFN!
